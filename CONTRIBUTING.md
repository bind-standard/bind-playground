# Contributing to BIND Playground

We welcome contributions from everyone in the insurance ecosystem — brokers, carriers, MGAs, TPAs, reinsurers, vendors, and developers.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a branch** for your change
3. **Make your changes** and commit them
4. **Open a pull request** against `main`

That's it. All contributions are reviewed before merging.

## What to Contribute

- **UI improvements** — Better form controls, layout tweaks, accessibility fixes.
- **New features** — Additional ways to explore or visualize BIND data.
- **Bug fixes** — Broken forms, rendering issues, incorrect schema handling.
- **Documentation** — Clarifications, examples, typo fixes.
- **Testing** — More test coverage for components and utilities.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused. One concept per pull request makes review easier.
- Include a clear description of *why* the change is needed, not just *what* changed.
- Follow existing patterns and naming conventions in the codebase.
- If proposing a significant change, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

## Code Quality

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
pnpm run test         # run tests
```
